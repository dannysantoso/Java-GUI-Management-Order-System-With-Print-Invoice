# Java-Internal-Management-Order

How to run the application:
1. Open the file in IDE or run bakerystore.jar
2. turn on the server (XAMPP) and create a database with the title "internal_management_order"
3. import the internal_management_order_db.sql database
4. if there is an error connecting to the database, maybe JDBC needs to be reconfigured in the build-path (remove the old mysql connector with the new mysql connector)
5. if you want to login to the system, you need to open the database and choose admin table to see email and password for login purpose
